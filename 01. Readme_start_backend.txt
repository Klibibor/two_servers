I've made customizable shop

Backend comunicates with API to frontend

with JWT key you can add Products, and only superuser can add new members

Backend part:

Backend is DJango architecture with API features to comunicate with frontend server

i have 3 backend folders
>backend
    it has settings.py for managing installed apps and api UI swagger and redoc
    urls.py that routes to shop folder and api folder

>shop   
    db.sqlite3
        database that contains
            1. Group products data
            2. Products data
            3. Users and user groups data
    models.py
        manages data from db.sqlite3 for:
            1. Group products data
            2. Products data
    views.py has 3 components  
        product group
            shows thegroup of products, supports CRUD from authenticated users
        product
            shows all the products inside its group, supports CRUD from authenticated users
        users 
            shows info on users, supports CRUD from authenticated users
>api
    it contains two folders views and serializers
        serializers is used to serialize data for the views.py in >shop
        views
            has auth.py which contains components for authrization logic
                1. APITokenObtainPairSerializer - creates tokens only validated users can use
                2. APITokenObtainPairView - serializes token obtained with APITokenObtainPairSerializer
                3. ReadOnlyOrJWT - utility used in views that determens which user can use safe methods and which can use CRUD
                4. MeAPIView - gives info of the curenlt loged on user
                5. LogoutView - handles logout logic

url logic
    in main folder - backend, I've imported urls from >api, and in api urls from >shop folders
    i've made swagger ui for interacting with backend without need for frontend UI
