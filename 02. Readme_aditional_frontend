After you started up the backend part we are adding another layer frontend server

This server communicates with backend api endpoints and gives app a nice front end look

It has 6 components

>index.js
    starting component
    renders the other components
    calls AppRoutes.js to call other components
>AppRoutes.js 
    enables links to components and sends to index.js to render them

>Layout.js
    1. frame for other components to be called
    2. checks authenitcated roles
    3. handles logout logic
    4. gives UI for calling components
>KorisniciCRUD.jsx
    1. LoginForm
